<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there,
  My name is Jean Clyde henry A. Laput, and I'm 28 years old. I live in Purok, Vista, Malunggay Street, Barangay Sinawal, General Santos City.
  I am here to learn some coding so that i can secure my future and to my family.
  This type of coding is new for me, because in my schooling before it never teach us or me to learn a programming. 
  That is why I am thaknful to my friend that looks like my brother to me Marky Pacanza for teaching and helping me to learn some codes.

  My Hobby, I do a lot of hobby because I am more expose to sport activities than academics before.
  My hobbies are Badminton, Boxing, Ping-pong, Running, Baseball, Martial art, and soccer. I don't think I call it a hobby but it's more likely a sport thingy. hahaha
  I don't play basketball though, basketball is very common here in the Philippines, I just dont know how to do it.
  The thing that i literally can call a hobby is Playing Video Games, I love Playing Video games so much, and I might put into my Hobby list the coding Program as well,
  coz its so much fun and challenging, makes your brain more active and stress at the same  time. HAHAHA
</p>

<p>
  I guess here how it end, I will do my very best to learn a coding and become a Website Developer in the future, Its one of my dream to become one.
